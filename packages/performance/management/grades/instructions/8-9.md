# 8.9 LAB CHECKPOINT: Grade Management System 💯

Read these guidelines in their entirety before implementing anything.
CSW8 Learning Goals
In preparation for the final project, we would like for you to exercise what you've learned so far by creating a course grade management system.

In this mini-project, you will incorporate functions from multiple labs to implement an interactive program, which you can use to compute grades in all your courses.

This mini-project is intended to be implemented in an IDE, which will allow you to run your code interactively. You will need to create several files in order to implement and test your functions as well as to run your main program.

The “Getting Started” section shows you the steps to modify the Main Program (Template), so that within 15-20 minutes, you should be able to have a fully running skeleton of the system.

Submission Requirements
You will not need to submit anything on zyBooks. You will need to submit three Python files to Gradescope.

Common Gradescope Questions: https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/faq/#gradescope

Important: The files need to be in the same folder on your computer. The import statements in your code will not work correctly, if the files are in different locations on your hard drive.

File 1 - all your functions
Instead of writing code in separate zyLabs, you will create a file called functions.py in which you will assemble all the relevant functions.

You do not need to use if __name__ == 'main'` in any of your files, because we can import your functions as shown below.

At the start of the other two files, you will need to import the functions as follows (functions is the name of our Python file/module; the asterisk * means "all/everything"):

from functions import *
This week's lab functions will need to be implemented and added to this file. You will have a single submission on Gradescope for all the functions from this week's labs.

File 2 - the main program
Create a new file main.py, which will contain your main program. As you will place all function definitions in the functions.py, we can import them here similar to the above import statement.

File 3 - test code
Create a separate file to test your work. Call it tests.py - this is where the assert statements will be collected to help you verify that your implementation of each function is correct.

Each function that returns values will need to have the corresponding assert statements to check its correctness.

If the assert statements are failing, then the autograder on Gradescope will fail as well.
If you are getting an AssertionError, then fix the corresponding function - do not modify the assert test to pass, fix the code instead.
Write your own assert statement to make sure to test all edge cases specified in the instructions: the autograder will be verifying that those work correctly.
You will need to submit all files at the same time to Gradescope (not in zyBooks).

Introduction
Our course management system, Gauchospace, does not seem to display grades and total percentages in an intuitive way. When you look at your total score in the gradebook, the number can be really low. This is especially in courses where the final project is 25% of the grade - until that assignment is graded, the highest total grade that you might see is 75%.

The best way to understand and work through this calculation is to use your Python skills and write a custom grade management and computation program.

A course syllabus typically outlines the breakdown of the course components and their contribution to the final course grade.

In this lab, you will set up the main program and its interaction with the user.

In the following labs, you will be writing the functions to add new features to your code to complete the data collection and grade computation.

Features
You will implement the following features for this system:

Create an interface that allows the users to interact with the system (will use while True and input() to collect user data).
Create a collection to store categories and grades that the users view, and can maintain by adding and updating entries.
Calculate the user's current overall grade in the course, given the grades for different categories.
You will need to use the code that you wrote in previous labs.

Main Menu
IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any global variables.

In your main program, you need to define a dictionary the_menu that has the options shown below.

"T" : "Total grade"
"L" : "List"
"A" : "Add"
"U" : "Update"
"D" : "Delete"
"S" : "Save the data"
"R" : "Restore data from file"
"Q" : "Quit this program"
The values to the left of the colon : are the dictionary keys with the corresponding value stored after the colon. Note that the dictionary keys and values should be stored as strings.

The menu should be printed by the print_main_menu() function when the user starts this system. 🎊 You already implemented this function in Week 7 Interactive Menu lab.

The print_main_menu() function does not return anything, it just prints the correctly-formatted options that are provided in the dictionary.

Main Program (Template)
We encourage you to carefully review the program code provided for you and ask us questions about it. For the final project, you will be required to create your own main program interaction code.

Use the following starter code to implement the main loop for your program:

# TODO 0: add an import statement to load the functions

the_menu = {} # TODO 1: add the options from the instructions
opt = None

while True:
    # print_main_menu(...) # TODO 2: uncomment, define the function, and call with the menu as an argument
    opt = input("::: Enter a menu option\n> ")
    opt = opt.upper() # to allow us to input lower- or upper-case letters

    if ...: # TODO 3: check of the character stored in opt is in the_menu dictionary
        print(f"WARNING: {opt} is an invalid menu option.\n")
        continue

    print(f"You selected option {opt} to > {the_menu[opt]}.")

    if opt == ...: # TODO 4: quit the program
        print("Goodbye!\n")
        break # exit the main `while` loop

    input("::: Press Enter to continue")

print("See you next time!")
Important: Every time you see the ::: and > in the prompts, it denotes the call to the input() function as shown in the starter code. After the "::: Press Enter to continue" prompt is displayed and the user presses Enter, the system is set up to print the main menu at the start of the loop.

Getting Started
Create the requested Python files.
Copy the above template into your main program file.
Upload the files to Gradescope to ensure the names are correct. You will need to submit all files at the same time to Gradescope (not in zyBooks).
Address the TODO comments in the code (explained below)
IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any global variables in your code.

Fix TODO 0:

add an import statement to load the functions into your main program file (see the "Submission Requirements" above)
while you have it in your clipboard, add the same import to the test file as well both files will need to call these functions.
Fix TODO 1:

Add the options from the instructions to the_menu dictionary inside the main program.
Note that the options above are provided in an almost-dictionary format (what types are the keys/values supposed to be?).
Fix TODO 2:

Use your previous print_main_menu() function to print the menu that you added in TODO 1.
Add this function to the file with all your functions.
Fix TODO 3:

to check if the value stored in opt is in the_menu dictionary, we need to look at the dictionary keys (note the new addition in the code that allows the program to accept the lower- and upper-case letters)
you can use the in operator, combined with not
alternatively, you can use the .get() method with the dictionary to detect if a key is not found
Fix TODO 4:

implement the "Quit" option.
Now, you can create the if/elif branches to call the functions for the various menu options. In the rest of the labs, you will get to implement the rest of the options, defining the needed functions, and calling them (remember to remove the TODO comments).

Create the test file
For each function that returns something in the functions.py file, you should add the corresponding assert statements to the tests.py.

Pro Tip: We recommend using the structure for the assert statements that we showed you on Figure 5.12.1.

For now, since the next checkpoint lab will rely on it:

add the get_list_avg() function implementation from LAB 7.15 to the functions.py
add the assert statements to check the function correctness in your test file
If you see an AssertionError, check the line number that the error message pointed to. In IDLE, you can select the "Show Line Numbers" option from the top "Options" menu. (Other IDLE tips.)

Feel free to add a few more tests to check for additional cases.

Back to top

You should now have a basic structure for the system, and you are ready to begin implementing each option.

Next steps
Once you assembled the above template and your main program and the testing code runs without any errors, submit your files to Gradescope.

We hope that you have fun putting this mini-project together!
