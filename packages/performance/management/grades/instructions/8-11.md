# 8.11 LAB (Grades System) "List" menu option

CSW8 Learning Goals
In this lab, you will practice

carefully reading the provided function documentation to know what to implement
writing a function with the default parameter value
using Boolean value as a flag for whether printing needs to occur
working with dictionaries stored inside a list (a nested list)
indexing and printing dictionary entries (potentially using enumerate())
formatting the output according to the specifications

Continue updating and submitting your files as described in the first checkpoint lab.

Instructions
This lab builds on the previous checkpoint labs. We assume that you have all_grades main list hard-coded in your program.

In the template below, we gave you the get_selection() function, which you need to add to your functions.py. You do not need to make any changes to this function - use it as is. This function is a bit unusual in that it uses input() but once you see how it is used within the main program, we hope that you will appreciate how much copy/pasting it has saved us. :-)

In the main program, add the following lines to ask the user whether they want to list the category or grade information:

    elif opt == 'L':
        subopt = get_selection(the_menu[opt], submenu)
        if subopt == 'C':
            print_grade_info(all_grades, show_grades = False)
        elif subopt == 'G':
            print_grade_info(all_grades)
The submenu is supposed to be a dictionary in the main program that will store the different sub-options that subopt can be assigned to.

Take a look at the branches to check what can be stored in subopt - those are the dictionary keys in submenu.
Take a look at the Sample Program Flow to Add Categories to see what the user sees as the values corresponding to those keys.
Implement the print_grade_info() function with the default parameter show_grades set to True.

⚠️ Add the implementation based on the documentation provided below.

Sample Program Flow
When the user selects the option "List", the program determines
whether they want to list the category or grade information and then displays the appropriate information.

Below is the result of the user selecting L from the main menu and then selecting C to show grade categories:

[ ... skipped the menu ... ]
::: Enter a menu option
> L
You selected option L to > List.
What would you like to list?
C - Categories
G - Grades
::: Enter your selection
> c
You selected C to list categories.
1 - PA (5%)
2 - CA (15%)
3 - LA (25.0%)
4 - Quiz (25%)
5 - Project (25%)
---
::: Press Enter to continue
Alternatively, when selecting G to show grades:

[ ... skipped the menu ... ]
::: Enter a menu option
> L
You selected option L to > List.
What would you like to list?
C - Categories
G - Grades
::: Enter your selection
> g
You selected G to list grades.
1 - PA (5%)
[100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 95.0]
2 - CA (15%)
[100.0, 100.0, 98.0, 95.0, 0.0, 100.0]
3 - LA (25.0%)
[100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 5.0, 0.0, 70.0]

::: Press Enter to continue
If the user entered an invalid option, the program automatically shows them the selection options again.
