# 8.10 LAB CHECKPOINT: (Grades System) Total Course Grade

CSW8 Learning Goals
In this lab, you will need to

Create a function to extract a list from a nested list that contains dictionaries

Read and follow function documentation
Use for loops to iterate over the items in a list, potentially using enumerate()
Use append() to add elements into a new list
Use list methods sum() and len() to compute the average of a list
Write a new function that uses previously-written functions as helpers
Create and run assert statements to check the function correctness
You are continuing to work with the files that you created in the previous checkpoint lab by adding the new functions and their tests to the respective files.

Introduction
In most courses, a course syllabus typically outlines 3-7 grade categories. Each category carries a percentage (weight) that it contributes to the final grade. For example, the percentages for some sample categories can be as follows

Participation: 10%
Labs: 30%
Quizzes: 30%
Project: 30%
How can you store these values?

You can store each category information in a dictionary, which captures a name of the category and its weight (i.e., the percentage of the total), and also stores grades that correspond to that category:

    {
        "category": "",
        "weight" : 0.0,
        "grades" : []
    }
You will also need to keep a "main" list to assemble the information for all categories: this list will store the record of each individual category (a nested list of dictionaries).

Instructions
This lab adds the following option to the main program:

elif opt == 'T':
    total = get_total_grade(all_grades, True)
    print("Current total is {total:.2f}")
In this lab, you will hard-code the information that is usually available in the syllabus and the corresponding grades to allow you to calculate the total grade.

Add the following nested list to your code in main.py, before the while loop.
While you have the list in your clipboard, copy it into your test file as well, so that you can write tests using it.
all_grades = [
    { "category": "PA",
      "weight" : 5,
      "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 95.0]
    },
    { "category": "CA",
      "weight" : 15,
      "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 98.0, 95.0, 0.0, 100.0]
    },
    { "category": "LA",
      "weight" : 25.0,
      "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 5.0, 0.0, 70.0]
    },
    { "category": "Quiz",
      "weight" : 25,
      "grades" : []
    },
    { "category": "Project",
      "weight" : 25,
      "grades" : []
    }
]
To compute the course grade, you will need the following functions (use the provided function stubs below):

get_grades()
a new function that you will write to iterate through the provided nested list to extract all grades into a new nested list of lists
carefully read the function documentation and the provided assert statements
note that the function parameter is called the info_list, which corresponds to the all_grades list in the main program (we will be using it as an argument when calling this function)
get_list_avg() - a function you already wrote in LAB 7.15 to compute the average for each extracted grade list
get_total_grade() - a new function that you will write to call the first two functions and then run the computation to get the total average grade (shown below)
In our main program, when we select the option T, we should see the following output:

You selected option T to > Show the total.
PA average 85.00% (4.25 / 5)
CA average 82.17% (12.33 / 15)
LA average 62.50% (15.62 / 25.0)
Quiz average 0.00% (0.00 / 25)
Project average 0.00% (0.00 / 25)
Current total is 32.20

Computation example
The following example will show you how we compute the final grade for the course using the weights and grades for those categories. The following information does NOT need to be printed out when the user chooses to Compute the grade.

The example below is to demonstrate the math behind the computation and to provide you with the information that you can use to debug your code.

Make sure that you understand each step of the computation - ask questions if something about it is unclear.

There are 5 categories in this example:
PA : 5.0% (0.05)
CA : 15.0% (0.15)
LA : 25.0% (0.25)
QUIZ : 25.0% (0.25)
PROJECT : 25.0% (0.25)

Provided grades:
PA grades [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 95.0] # 7 elements
CA grades [100.0, 100.0, 98.0, 95.0, 0.0, 100.0] # 6 elements
LA grades [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 5.0, 0.0, 70.0] # 6 elements
Quiz grades []
Project grades []

Sum of grades for the PA category: 595.00
Sum of grades for the CA category: 493.00
Sum of grades for the LA category: 375.00
Sum of grades for the Quiz Category: 0.00
Sum of grades for the Project category: 0.00

Average of the PA category: 595.00/7 = 85.00
Average of the CA category: 493.00/6 = 82.17
Average of the LA category: 375.00/6 = 62.50
Average of the Quiz category:  0.00
Average of the Project category:  0.00

Average grade for the PA category: 85.00 * 0.05 =  4.25
Average grade for the CA category: 82.17 * 0.15 =  12.32
Average grade for the LA category: 62.50 * 0.25 =  15.62
Average grade for the Quiz category: 0 * 0.25 = 0.00
Average grade for the Project category: 0 * 0.25 =  0.00

Total Average grade = 4.25 + 12.32 + 15.62 + 0.00 + 0.00 = 32.20

Pseudo Code for calculating the average grade in the get_total_grade()
set overall avg_sum to 0
call get_grades(info_list) to get the list only_grades
call get_list_avg() with the previous list as its input to get the list avg_grades

for each category and its position in info_list:  # you might want to use enumerate()
   get the category average value from avg_grades (at the same index as it is in info_list)
   get the category weight from the info_list
   compute the category grade: (category average value * (category weight / 100))
   add the category grade to avg_sum
   if show_steps:
       print(f"{...} average {...:.2f}%", end =" ") # see the example in the instructions
       print(f"{...} / {...}")

return the avg_sum
Carefully read each function documentation - do not remove it, follow it.

Test your code
➡️ Add the hard-coded example of the all_grades list to your test file. Use it to check that your function works correctly.

only_grades = [[100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 95.0], [100.0, 100.0, 98.0, 95.0, 0.0, 100.0], [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 5.0, 0.0, 70.0], [], []]
assert get_grades(all_grades) == only_grades

only_grades_test = [
    { "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 95.0] },
    { "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 98.0, 95.0, 0.0, 100.0] },
    { "grades" : [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 5.0, 0.0, 70.0] },
    { "grades" : [] },
    { "grades" : [] }
] # same as all_grades but without the other keys
assert get_grades(only_grades_test) == only_grades

avg_grades = [85.0, 82.16666666666667, 62.5, 0, 0]
assert get_list_avg(only_grades) == avg_grades

assert get_total_grade(all_grades) - 32.20 <= 0.001
assert int(get_total_grade([])) == 0
Copy your assert statements for get_list_avg() as well and add more assertions for your functions.
