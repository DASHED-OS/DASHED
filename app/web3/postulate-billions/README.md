# postulate-billions
We learn that in order to postualte billions we have to consider the effect of numbers and placement of zeros have as an effect of balance. This will gonverge with the momentum of money flow and this will relate to the size of the various traders. 

We will reveal where dominant market players have positioned thier orders, help spot aggressive market buyers and sellers, and clearly identify actual levels of support and resistance. 

In other words volume validates price, which will give us a 3-D view of the monney as it moves about the market expecially with a volume profile. As the volume acts as the volocity for the change in market. We gather the effort in relation to result, which is not always even, telling the true story of the markets manipulation and hwere the big zeros are moving. 

We aim to automate this analysis however VPA operates on feelings and instinct so we have to teach this to the ML as well. We go about this by allowing a certain percent of slippage, covering all assets and allowing the bot to make a indecision decision. 

Keeping track of your micro to macro to global analysis can be made easier by counting backward from the candle currently developing to the previous candles on the chart.
